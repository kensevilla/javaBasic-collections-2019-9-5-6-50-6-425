**should_resize_array**
1.to resize array on runtime. https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-e&q=resize+array+in+compile+time&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXncCO-NzkAhVVM94KHVJODJcQBQgsKAA&biw=1920&bih=943
2. at first it failed because it is throwing ArrayOutOfBoundsException since I forgot to change the values of all the needed variables 
3. to match the expected out put
4. None

**should_go_through_an_iterator**
1. to know how iterator works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-iterator-in-java/
2. 
3. since Iterator has predefined method to check if there is more items -hasNext() and to get the value of the next item -next(). then I can just loop the list and use those methods
4. None

**should_create_a_sequence_without_putting_all_items_into_memory**
1. to know how iterator works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-iterator-in-java/
2. 
3. since Iterator is implemented, then I can just create my own logic for the hasNext and next
4. None

**should_predict_linked_list_operation_result**
  1. to know how iterator works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-iterator-in-java/
  2. I assumed first that "Amy" will be the one removed from the list.
  3. since Iterator is used, then next will always be executed when using iterator, thus removing "Juliet" which is next to "Amy"
  4. None
  
  **should_generate_distinct_sequence_on_the_fly**
  1. to know how iterator works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-iterator-in-java/
  2. first I do not know how to manipulate an Iterator
  3. since I already has Iterator as my argument, then I can just manipulate that Iterator inside an Iterator to filter and get the values needed
  4. None
  
  **should_predict_linked_list_operation_result**
1. to know how subList works. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arraylist-sublist-method-in-java-with-examples/
2. 
3. the subList will get items from the list given the starting and ending index. when clear() is used, it will remove the items from the actual list therefore leaving (0, 1, 2, 10, 11) as the ones left in the list
4. None
